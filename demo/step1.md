Let's confirm where we are

Rather than type the commands on the right part of the screen - Just click on the symbol at the end of the command.

First practice

uname -a tells us a bit about the resource that we are connected to

```
uname -a
```{{execute}}

Ok Great|  Let's move to our command to display the "Hello World" text on the screen
We will echo what we type and concatonate it into the file

```
echo "Hello World"
```{{execute}}

Great Job!
Let's take it another step and save our text to a file


```
echo "Hello World" > hello.txt
```{{execute}}

Perfect!

Let's keep going.
