Step 3

Let's get a little bit creative and add something to our text and use 2 at the end of the text file

```
echo  "Hello World from Katacode" > helloworld2.txt
```{{execute}}

You will notice there are now two files
```
 ls -l
```{{execute}}

Let's confirm the contents of the new file

```
 cat helloworld2.txt
```{{execute}}

You now the the additional text file helloworld2.txt

Ok Great|  That was easy Let's finish up
