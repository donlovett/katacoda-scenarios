Final Summary

In this short course we have created both a public and a private ssh key

We have created a text file 

We have calulated the hash or digest of our file

We have signed our text file with our newly created private ssh key

We have validated the signed file with our public ssh key

Quite a set of tasks

Well  Padawan - I hope to see you again in a glaxey not so far far away!
